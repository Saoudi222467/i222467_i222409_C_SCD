                        Located near Skardu, the Katpana Cold Desert is a surreal landscape of sand dunes, rocky outcrops, and snow-capped peaks. Spanning an area of approximately 2,500 square kilometers, the desert is one of the highest deserts in the world, with elevations ranging from 2,226 to 4,304 meters above sea level. Visitors can marvel at its stark beauty, go camel riding on the sand dunes, or simply soak in the breathtaking vistas of this unique natural wonder in Gilgit-Baltistan.
