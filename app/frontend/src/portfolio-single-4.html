                        Formed by a natural disaster in 2010, Attabad Lake is a mesmerizing turquoise gem amidst the rugged mountains of Gilgit-Baltistan. Spanning over 21 kilometers, the lake offers pristine waters for boating and fishing against a backdrop of towering cliffs. With a population of around 1,000 people, the lakeside village of Attabad serves as a tranquil retreat for travelers seeking to explore its serene shores and hidden coves.
