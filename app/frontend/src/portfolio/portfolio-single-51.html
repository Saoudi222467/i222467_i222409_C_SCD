                        The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, was one of the world's earliest urban civilizations, flourishing in the fertile plains of present-day Pakistan and northwest India around 2500 BCE. Renowned for its advanced urban planning, sophisticated drainage systems, and impressive architecture, the civilization thrived for over a millennium before mysteriously declining around 1900 BCE.

Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa were the two largest urban centers of the Indus Valley Civilization, showcasing remarkable feats of engineering and urban organization. The civilization had highly developed culture, evidenced by its elaborate pottery, intricate seals, and distinctive script that is yet to be fully deciphered. Trade networks extended across the region and beyond, facilitating the exchange of goods such as precious metals, gemstones, and textiles.
