                        Keenjhar Lake, also known as Kalri Lake, is Sindh's second-largest freshwater lake, spanning approximately 22 kilometers. Providing water supply to Thatta and Karachi, it offers serene views and recreational activities. Surrounded by palm trees and cabana-style huts, it's a popular destination for locals and tourists alike, especially during the summer months.
