                        Lahore Fort, constructed in the 16th century during the reign of Emperor Akbar, showcases the grandeur of Mughal architecture and served as a royal residence for centuries. Adjacent to the fort stands the Badshahi Mosque, completed in 1673 under Emperor Aurangzeb's patronage, making it one of the largest mosques globally. Both sites stand as architectural marvels and key historical landmarks, witnessing significant events throughout Pakistan's history.
