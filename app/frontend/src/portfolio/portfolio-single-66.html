                        Discover the military legacy of Peshawar at the Bala Hisar Fort, whose origins date back over 2,000 years to the ancient Kushan period. Strategically located atop a hill overlooking the city, the fort has been repeatedly rebuilt and renovated by various rulers, including the Mughals, Sikhs, and British. Today, the fort serves as a symbol of Peshawar's resilience and heritage, offering panoramic views of the city and housing military installations and government offices.
