                        Experience the serenity and grandeur of the Faisal Mosque, an architectural marvel and one of the largest mosques in the world. Completed in 1986, the mosque was named after King Faisal bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia, who funded its construction as a gift to the Pakistani people. Designed by Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay, the mosque's modernist design incorporates elements of traditional Islamic architecture, with its iconic white marble domes and minarets dominating Islamabad's skyline.
