                        The Karakoram Highway, one of the world's highest paved roads, winds through the breathtaking landscapes of Pakistan's Gilgit-Baltistan region, connecting it with China's Xinjiang region. Spanning over 1,200 kilometers, this engineering marvel offers unparalleled views of snow-capped peaks and glistening glaciers. Built in the 20th century, it remains a vital artery for trade and travel, linking diverse cultures and communities along its route.
